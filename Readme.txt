I didn't have time to finish the stories 3, 9, 10 and 11.
I think the story 3 might not be the simple example as editQuestion.php. It might need the function to check each question and question types, and also update the questions in the sumitQuestion.php page.
If these two page need to refactor, I might need another 5-6 hours.
For the story 9, it seems like a query to select the data and create a report for the data.
This might need 1-2 hours.
For the story 10, I do have test folder to include the testing management system.
People can login as 'admin' to test all functions, but I didn't finish the error message for each function.
This might need 1-2 hours.
For the story 11, I think I need another 1-2 hours to finish it.
